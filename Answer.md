1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

Answer -

The "category_id" attribute in the "product" table serves as a foreign key referencing the primary key of the "product_category" table. This establishes a relationship where each product must belong to a specific product category.

In "productSchema" of the schema.js file, the "category_id" is the foreign key that references the "ProductCategory" model by its ObjectId.

2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

Answer -

By setting the 'required' property to 'true' in the "category_id" field of the Product schema, we can ensure that every product in the Product table must have a value for the category_id field.

If no value is entered for the category_id field, a validation error would be thrown.
